# 16bit_memory_verilog

This project implements a 16-bit memory using eight 2-bit registers.  
It demonstrates memory organization, register interconnection, and simulation with Icarus Verilog + GTKWave.

## ðŸ§© Features
- 8 registers (2 bits each)
- Read/Write control logic
- Address-based selection
- Simulated using **Icarus Verilog** and visualized in **GTKWave**
